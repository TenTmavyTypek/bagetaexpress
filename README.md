Bageta Express is a web application tailored for students by students, offering a seamless way to order baguettes from third-party suppliers, all with direct delivery to your school. Our user-friendly platform showcases a catalog of baguette types, making it easy to select and place your orders.

## Key Features:

- **Simplified Ordering:** Explore a wide variety of available baguette types in our catalog, and place your order with ease.

- **Supplier Efficiency:** Suppliers benefit from efficient order management, catalog editing, and the ability to set order time windows.

- **Swift Order Identification:** Our unique QR code and PIN pairing system ensures quick order identification, streamlining order pickup.

- **Powered by Unicorn:** Bageta Express is built using the uuApp framework by Unicorn, a leading technology company. Our collaboration with Unicorn significantly contributes to the development and management of this project.

## Location:

- Bageta Express is currently located in Slovakia, specifically in the Košický region, Spišská Nová Ves.

## Future Plans:

- We are committed to enhancing the user experience and functionality of Bageta Express. Future plans include adding new features, improving performance, and expanding to new schools.

**Open to Collaboration:**

- Bageta Express is open to collaboration with new suppliers and schools interested in our platform. We welcome partnerships to provide students with even more options and convenience.

### Under Construction:
